# GDHTTPServer
A very simple HTTP server written in pure Godot. Best used in small, short-lived usecases.

## Using in your own project
All the code is contained within [httpserver.gd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xaltaq/GDHTTPServer/master/httpserver.gd). Simply download this file and place it anywhere in your project.

## Running examples
Download or clone this repository, and import project.godot inside the Godot editor. Running the project will display a window with the example scripts in the examples directory, which you can run directly from the game.
